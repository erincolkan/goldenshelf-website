# GoldenShelf Website

This website has been created with the purpose of introducing our non-profit mobile application named GoldenShelf where people within the same city can exchange and donate books. Website is active on GitHub Pages at the following link: https://erincolkan.github.io/goldenshelf-website/ 

IMPORTANT NOTICE: "Spaghetti Design Pattern" was deliberately used in some areas since the project was small and we needed a faster development process. 

Thank you.
